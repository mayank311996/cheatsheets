# PEP8

#### The guide is located [here](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/).

The summary of PEP8 standard is given below for a quick reference. 

- Choosing sensible names will save you time and energy later. You’ll be able to figure out, from the name, what a certain variable, function, or class represents. You’ll also avoid using inappropriate names that might result in errors that are difficult to debug.

- Note: Never use l, O, or I single letter names as these can be mistaken for 1 and 0, depending on typeface.
