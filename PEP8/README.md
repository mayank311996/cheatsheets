# PEP8 

#### The guide is located [here](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/).

The summary of PEP8 standard is given below for a quick reference.

### Naming Conventions

- Choosing sensible names will save you time and energy later. You’ll be able to figure out, from the name, what a certain variable, function, or class represents. You’ll also avoid using inappropriate names that might result in errors that are difficult to debug.

- Note: Never use l, O, or I single letter names as these can be mistaken for 1 and 0, depending on typeface.

- Choosing names for your variables, functions, classes, and so forth can be challenging. You should put a fair amount of thought into your naming choices when writing code as it will make your code more readable. The best way to name your objects in Python is to use descriptive names to make it clear what the object represents.

### Code Layout

- Surround top-level functions and classes with two blank lines.

- Surround method definitions inside classes with a single blank line.

- Use blank lines sparingly inside functions to show clear steps. 

- PEP 8 suggests lines should be limited to 79 characters. This is because it allows you to have multiple files open next to one another, while also avoiding line wrapping. Python will assume line continuation if code is contained within parentheses, brackets, or braces. 

- If it is impossible to use implied continuation, then you can use backslashes to break lines instead. 

### Indentation

- You should use spaces instead of tabs when indenting code. You can adjust the settings in your text editor to output 4 spaces instead of a tab character, when you press the Tab key.
