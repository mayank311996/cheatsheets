Troubleshooting Connection Faqs

1.  Make sure you AWS Endpoint region is the same Region as your AWS IoT Core and where you created your device Certificates

2.  Make sure MQTT(S) Port 8883 isnt being blocked by your Network Admin

3.  Make sure your network connecting to your device is at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz

Also check the monitor tab in AWS IoT Core if you arnt getting data. 
If it shows you connected to AWS IoT Core but no data is being transmitted
to the AWS IoT 'Test' Console than it most likly is a problem with your Certificates
not being valif or not being formatted correctly
