## Run

```bash
conda create -n scikit-dev python=3.6
conda activate scikit-dev
conda install scikit-learn=0.20.2 jupyter pandas pylint rope
conda list 
```

```bash
sls create --template aws-python3 --name california-housing
```

Installing on plugin
```bash
sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements@4.2.4 
```

- When you have backend and frontend on different domains 
you need to specify "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*" in 
handler.py. For now this means we allow any domain to query our 
backend but in production you should specify only one domain that can 
query your backend.

To test function locally with serverless 
```bash
sls invoke local --function predict-price --path event.json
```

- You can also use unit test to test your function. Explore more!
- requirements.txt is needed because we are using dockerizePip: true in 
custom section in serverless.yml file. This dockerizePip option 
helps to install dependencies as a docker container. This is very compatible
with AWS Linux machines used by AWS Lambda.
- slim: true option in serverless.yml file under custom section helps to 
reduce size of .so file generated by python dependencies installation.
