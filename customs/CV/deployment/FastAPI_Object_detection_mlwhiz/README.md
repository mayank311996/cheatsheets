## Tasks 

- Setting Up an Amazon Instance
- Creating a FastAPI API for Object Detection
- Deploying FastAPI using Docker
- An End to End App with UI

## Run

We will be using a Pytorch pre-trained fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn detection model from the torchvision.models for object detection, which is trained on the COCO dataset to keep the code simple
